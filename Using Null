-- 1. List the teachers who have NULL for their department
SELECT name 
FROM teacher 
WHERE dept IS NULL;

-- 2. Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher
-- Example. No code necessary

-- 3. Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed
SELECT 
  teacher.name, 
  dept.name
FROM teacher 
LEFT JOIN dept
  ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);
  
-- 4. Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed
SELECT 
  teacher.name, 
  dept.name
FROM teacher 
RIGHT JOIN dept
  ON (teacher.dept=dept.id);
  
-- 5. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'
SELECT 
  name, 
  COALESCE(mobile, '07986 444 2266') AS "mobile number"
FROM teacher;

-- 6. Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name
SELECT 
  t.name, 
  COALESCE(d.name, 'None') AS "department"
FROM teacher t
LEFT JOIN dept d
  ON t.dept=d.id;
  
-- 7. Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones
SELECT 
  COUNT(name) AS "count teachers", 
  COUNT(mobile) AS "count mobile"
from teacher;

-- 8. Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff
SELECT 
  d.name, 
  COUNT(t.name) AS "number of staff"
FROM dept d
LEFT JOIN teacher t
  ON d.id=t.dept
GROUP BY d.name;

-- 9. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise
SELECT 
  name,
  CASE 
    WHEN dept = 1 then 'Sci'
    WHEN dept = 2 then 'Sci'
    ELSE 'Art' 
  END AS "dept name"
FROM teacher;

-- 10. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise
SELECT 
  name,
  CASE 
    WHEN dept = 1 THEN 'Sci'
    WHEN dept = 2 THEN 'Sci'
    WHEN dept = 3 THEN 'Art'
    ELSE 'None' 
  END AS "dept name"
FROM teacher;
